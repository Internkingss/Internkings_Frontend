            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>
                The PM Internship Scheme attracts talented youth from every corner of India, including rural areas, tribal districts, and remote colleges. Many of these bright candidates are first-generation learners who may have limited digital exposure and no prior internship experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                We noticed that with hundreds of internships listed, it can be overwhelming for candidates to find the right fit. This often leads to misaligned applications and brilliant talent missing out on great opportunities.
            </p>
            <h1>What We Do</h1>
            <p>
                InternKings solves this problem with a simple, lightweight AI-based recommendation engine. Our goal is to suggest the most relevant internships to each candidate based on their unique profile, academic background, interests, and location preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of a long, confusing list, we provide 3-5 personalized suggestions in a clear, easy-to-understand format. Our platform is user-friendly, mobile-compatible, and designed to empower every candidate to make informed choices for their career.
