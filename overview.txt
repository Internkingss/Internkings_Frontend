Of course\! Here is a clear breakdown of the project structure and the purpose of each file. This documentation will help any developer quickly understand how the "InternKings" website is built and how it works.

-----

### \#\# Project Overview 

**InternKings** is a lightweight, front-end prototype for an internship recommendation engine. It's designed as a multi-page website using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. The core functionality is to guide a user through a simple process: logging in, entering their preferences, and receiving a filtered list of suitable internships. The code is intentionally simple to maintain and easy to integrate.

### \#\# Recommended File Structure

For better organization, the project files are structured by type. This separation of concerns makes the codebase cleaner and more scalable.

```
InternKings/
├── favicon.png               # Site icon for browser tabs
├── login.html                # The main login page (entry point)
├── home.html                 # Landing page after successful login
├── about.html                # Page describing the project's mission
├── contact.html              # Page with a contact/feedback form
├── details.html              # Form for users to enter internship preferences
├── recommendations.html        # Page to display internship results
│
├── style.css                 # Single CSS file for all styling
│
├── login.js                  # JavaScript for the login page
├── contact.js                # JavaScript for the contact form
├── details.js                # JavaScript for the details form
└── recommendations.js        # JavaScript for the recommendations page
```

### \#\# Component Breakdown: What Each File Does

Here is a detailed explanation of each file's role in the project.

### \#\#\# HTML Files (The Structure)

The HTML files define the content and structure of each page.

  * `login.html`: The **entry point** of the website. It contains a simple form for a username and password.
  * `home.html`: The **main dashboard** or landing page after a user logs in. It has the primary call-to-action button ("Get Your Internship Now").
  * `about.html`: A static page that provides context on the **problem** the platform solves and its **mission**.
  * `contact.html`: Contains a form for users to submit suggestions or feedback.
  * `details.html`: This is a crucial page containing the **user input form**. It captures the candidate's location, field of interest, and qualifications.
  * `recommendations.html`: This page **displays the final internship suggestions**. It contains three different `div` sections (one for Tech, one for HealthCare, and one for Finance), which are hidden by default.

-----

### \#\#\# CSS File (The Style)

There is only one CSS file to keep styling simple and consistent.

  * `style.css`: This is the **single source of truth for all visual styling**. It includes:
      * **Global Styles:** Basic styles for the `body`, fonts, and color theme (white and light blue).
      * **Shared Components:** Styling for recurring elements like the `navbar`, `.btn` (buttons), and `.internship-card`.
      * **Layout:** Flexbox and Grid rules for structuring content.
      * **Media Queries:** Responsive styles to ensure the site looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

-----

### \#\#\# JavaScript Files (The Logic & Interactivity)

Each JavaScript file is responsible for the logic of a specific page, making the site interactive.

  * `login.js`:

      * Listens for the login form submission.
      * Checks if the credentials are `admin` and `1234`.
      * **Redirects** the user to `home.html` on success or shows an error alert on failure.

  * `contact.js`:

      * Handles the submission of the contact form.
      * Prevents the page from reloading.
      * Shows a "response has been submitted" confirmation alert and clears the form.

  * `details.js`:

      * This is the **data-passing mechanism**.
      * It intercepts the "Find My Internship" form submission.
      * It reads the selected value from the "Field of Interest" dropdown.
      * It then redirects the user to `recommendations.html` and passes the chosen interest as a **URL parameter** (e.g., `recommendations.html?interest=tech`).

  * `recommendations.js`:

      * This script makes the recommendations page **dynamic**.
      * When the page loads, it reads the `interest` parameter from the URL.
      * Based on the value (`tech`, `healthcare`, or `finance`), it finds the corresponding hidden `div` on the page and changes its `display` from `none` to `block`, revealing the correct set of internships to the user.
